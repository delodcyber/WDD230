    <h1>Two personas</h1>
    <h2>Jhon </h2>
    <p> 
        He is 25 years old, and he works at the office 5 days a week. 
        He loves to spend time outside with his friends and he wants to spend his 
        weekends outside of the city, farther from civilization. He wants to be sure that the weather will be 
        good for the time of his trips so he chacks the weather websites to be sure in his trip.</p>
    <h2>Melissa </h2>
    <p>She is an old lady, 65 years old, and she loves to read some news and look for the weather 
        for the next days because she has 7 kids in different parts of the country. 
        They are all married and have their families, but Melissa as a mother calls 
        them often and checks how they are doing, 
        also she checks the weather often in different cities for her kids.</p>
        <h1>Scenarios</h1>
        <p>Is there going to be good weather for the trip?</p>
        <p>We did not have rain for a long time. When will it rain?</p>
        <p>What is the best day for us to climb the mountain?</p>
        <p>I heard about a storm. Can you look for the details of it?</p>
        <p>Will it be cold in the morning for running?</p>
